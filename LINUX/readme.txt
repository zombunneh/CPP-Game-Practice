To build on Linux:
- copy the makefile from this directory into the same directory as the source files.
- run in a terminal 'make' in the source directory.


If it complains on missing libraries, then the libraries libsdl2-dev, libsdl2-image-dev and libsdl2-ttf-dev need to be installed. Install these dependencies according to your Linux installation. For example on Ubuntu(and derivatives) you use "sudo apt install libsdl2-dev libsdl2-image-dev libsdl2-ttf-dev"
